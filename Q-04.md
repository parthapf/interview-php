# Array addition

Write a function that accepts two square matrices (N x N two dimensional arrays), and return the sum of the two. 

Visualisation:
```
|1 2 3|     |2 2 1|     |1+2 2+2 3+1|     |3 4 4| 

|3 2 1|  +  |3 2 3|  =  |3+3 2+2 1+3|  =  |6 4 4| 

|1 1 1|     |1 1 3|     |1+1 1+1 1+3|     |2 2 4| 
```



Note: Both matrices being passed into the function will be of size N x N (square), containing only integers.
